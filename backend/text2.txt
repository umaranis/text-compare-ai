Brief Description of the Course
In this course, we will cover the fundamentals of networking through analysis of the Open System
Interconnection (OSI) and Internet networking models. Students will learn the role of each model layer and the
technologies used to provide end-to-end
connectivity between computer systems and the associated networking protocols. The course will also
introduce cloud computing and investigate the role of cybersecurity in securing information systems and the
impacts of threats to individual
persons and society as well as ethical and legal considerations. The role of personnel and encryption to secure
Internet communications will also be studied.
The course also contains a hurdle task which requires students to get involved with their local IT
community through attendance and participation in events, such as seminars, workshops, expos,
discussion forums etc. The aim is to provide students with a broad understanding of the IT industry, its
research foundations and its place in servicing society.

FEDTASKS
Federation University recognises that students require key transferable employability skills to prepare them for
their future workplace and society. FEDTASKS ( Transferable Attributes Skills and Knowledge) provide a
targeted focus on ﬁve key transferable Attributes, Skills, and Knowledge that are be embedded within
curriculum, developed gradually towards successful measures and interlinked with cross-discipline and Co-
operative Learning opportunities. One or more FEDTASK, transferable Attributes, Skills or Knowledge must be
evident in the speciﬁed learning outcomes and assessment for each FedUni course, and all must be directly

Planned Student Learning
A 15-credit point course typically involves a minimum of 150 hours of learning, that may include scheduled
(timetabled) and unscheduled, ﬂexible and self-paced activities. The scheduled hours of student learning will be
experienced primarily through on-campus and/or online engagement opportunities with peers and teaching
staﬀ. For approximately every hour of scheduled or directed activity, a minimum of two hours of student
directed learning is expected.
Unscheduled, ﬂexible and self-paced activities do not require a set day, time or location and require students to
work independently. These will include established learning activities, associated independent learning,
background reading/research and completion of assessment. Students are expected to access electronic
research databases and use computers to facilitate their learning.
Learning Activity Description Hours
Attend/watch lectures and laboratoriesStudents should attend/watch weekly lectures
and laboratory sessions.48
Independent study outside formal lectures and
laboratoriesStudents should spend at least 1.5 hours per
week reviewing lecture slides, reviewing or

Course Description (Higher Education)
ITECH1102
Laboratory Tasks : Students are required to complete set computing, networking and security tasks during
laboratory sessions of that particular lab. Upon completing the tasks, students get
marks allocated for those tasks in the lab. The students need to be present in the lab to receive the marks. The
tasks are designed to help students understand the material covered in lectures by interaction with computing
systems. These tasks relate to learning outcomes K1, K4, K5, S1 - S3, and A1 - A4.
Network Planning Assignment : This is an individual assignment. Students are required to develop an IP
network plan for the scenario given in the Assignment speciﬁcation. Students must analyse the lecture material,
solve any given problem, research associated concepts and technologies and develop a coherent network plan
for the given scenario. These tasks relate to learning outcomes K1, K2, K3, K4, and A1.
Mid-Semester Test : This task requires students to undertake a test. The test will examine the understanding
of the concepts covered in the past weeks. Questions might cover the material covered in the lecture and labs
until Week 7. This test assesses learning outcomes K1 - K5, S1 - S3, and A1 - A4.
End of Semester Test/Exam : This task will test the understanding and application of knowledge and skills,
covered throughout the semester. Learning outcomes examined could include K1 - K5, S1 - S3, and A1 - A4.
 
Submission and Return of Student Work
Marks for all the tasks will be available on Moodle/fdlgrades - 2 weeks after the deadline of the task found in this
course description.
 
Assessment Criteria
In order to receive a passing grade in this course, students must receive an overall passing mark in the
combined result of all assessment tasks.
Topics Assessed
All topics covered during this course are subject to assessment.
Academic Integrity
Academic integrity is behaving honestly, responsibly and respectfully in our academic endeavours. We
demonstrate integrity in our study by producing our own, original work and by properly acknowledging when we
use the work of others to inform ours. Whether accidental or deliberate, using the work of others without
acknowledgement constitutes a breach of academic integrity. Other forms of cheating include but are not
limited to collusion, plagiarism and using free or paid services to produce academic work, which is known as
contract cheating. 
The Academic Integrity Module (AIM) introduces you to the skills you need to demonstrate academic integrity,
such as referencing and paraphrasing. All students at Federation University are required to complete AIM prior
to submitting their ﬁrst assessment task in their program of study. Refer to the following:

Assistance with study skills and assessment
The Federation University Study Skills website contains practical advice on improving your reading and writing
skills, paraphrasing and referencing, and time management. It also provides advice about learning technology
and connecting with Student Academic Leaders and Learning Skills Advisors to support your academic skill
development.
Study Skills for Life
Assistance with Online Submission
Students are often asked to submit assignments online, mostly through the course Moodle shell. You may be
required to submit via Turnitin, which is similarity-checking software. Diﬃculty with online submission can have
numerous causes, such as not completing the Academic Integrity Module (AIM – see above); unreliable internet
connection; or an oversized ﬁle. If you experience diﬃculties ensure you have completed AIM, and refer to the
following guides about online submission:
Study Skills website  (Assignment Submission)
About Turnitin
Late Assignment
Late submission of assessment tasks, without a granted Discretionary Extension  from the Course Coordinator or
an approved Special Consideration , will attract a late penalty. All reasonable attempts must be made in
submitting each assessment task.
The University-wide late penalty is 5% per day of the total marks available (including weekends and public
holidays).
Marking will cease after 7 days and the assessment will be scored at zero. If an assessment task is submitted
beyond 7 days and receives zero, feedback provision is at the discretion of the Course Coordinator.
For more information regarding late penalties,please see here.
Special Consideration
If students are adversely aﬀected by life circumstances a discretionary assessment extension of up to ﬁve
University working days for one assessment task may be granted at the discretion of the tutor, lecturer, or
course coordinator (dependent on school process) upon a direct request by the student via the Discretionary
Assessment Extension form. If, however, a student has experienced or encountered some form of disadvantage
or impediment (medical reasons; hardship/trauma; compassionate grounds; other signiﬁcant cause) in more
than one course and requires more than ﬁve working days’ extension, then they are advised to apply for Special
Consideration. For further information on Discretionary Assessment Extensions and Special Consideration,
including access to the policy, procedures or associated forms,
