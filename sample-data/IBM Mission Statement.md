IBM Mission Statement

Our mission and purpose is to be a catalyst that makes the world work better. A catalyst is an agent of change. 

As catalysts, IBMers collaborate to release new energy. We forge partnerships and bring together powerful combinations of people and technology. 

We combine the methods of science with the dynamism business to do things neither could do on its own. We solve difficult problems and amplify the impact of our solutions with speed and scale. 

Our work is focused on the most mission-critical systems on the planet: electrical grids, airlines, mobile networks, banks, transportation systems, healthcare systems. 

These systems are more than just engines of economic growth. They are the systems that support modern society. In making them faster, more productive, and more secure, we don’t just make business work better, we make the world work better.
